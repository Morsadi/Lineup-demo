## Intoduction

LineupNow is a tool that was inspired by being part of multiple Tennis groups. It is supposed to help event organizers create lineups and arrange tennis games for their groups.


### Problems to solve:
- The event organizer has to send weekly invites to more than 50 people multiple times before the game day.
- The event organizer can be bombarded with email replies, whether they are confirming, declining or asking questions.
- The players could be confused if the organizer hasn't sent the weekly invites.
- Sometimes players don't receive or can lose the weekly email.
- If the number of players on the list doubles, the organizer might take off.
- It can be impossible to create the lineups using the phone

### Solved:
- The players can signup to the coming game on their own using this tool.
- They can check the time, date, location, lineup and the assigned courts without having to email the organizer.
- The organizer only has to reset the week (2 clicks), with a new date, time and location instead of drafting an invitation email.
- Easy to use the tool from any device.


### User Stories
#### As a player:
- I can signup anytime of the week.

#### As an event organizer:
- I can see a list of the signed-up players.
- I can see the lineup as I add players
- I can add players to the lineup.
- I can delete a group from the lineup (before saving) to re-arrange the players.
- I can set the court number to each group.
- I don't have to immediately assign a court number to the lineup.
- When I refresh, I should be able to see the new signups as I was working on the old ones. Should see the new and old signups. 
- I can put less than four players in the last court if players are needed or dropped out.
